        date: "10 | 04 | 2019",
        text:   [`The shared value of sustainability, the importance of partnerships to create sustainable solutions, and the urgency with which these solutions need to be put in place were among the top themes at the opening event for Walmart’s 2019 Sustainability Milestone Meeting, held today at the retail giant’s home office in Bentonville, AR. The meeting was attended (in person and online) by more than 700 suppliers, environmental NGOs, and Walmart associates, and provided updates on a range of initiatives the company is working on with these groups to improve sustainability performance across global value chains.
                Kicking off the event, Kathleen McLaughlin, Senior Vice President & Chief Sustainability Officer of Walmart Inc. and President of the Walmart Foundation, told attendees, “All of us here in this room are in some way engaged in helping bring affordable, quality food, apparel, and general merchandise to people all across the country and other places in the world. We want to do it in a way that is sustainable, socially and environmentally. That’s what brings us here today. It’s our commitment to bring these products to people in a way that is sustainable. We share that commitment.”
                Social sustainability, she explained, means caring for the people involved in making and delivering the products to customers—an area that includes challenges such as forced labor and working conditions. Environmental sustainability, she said, means caring about emissions, waste, and what happens to our natural systems.`,
                `“At Walmart, for years we have been encouraging our associates, our suppliers and many others that we work with to address these issues,” McLaughlin said. “Why do we do this? We work on this because it creates shared value. What do I mean by this? Value for business and value for communities, people, and society. Socially and environmentally, we’ve made a ton of progress, and we’ll celebrate that today.”
                However, she cautioned, urgency is needed. “We all read the news, we see what’s going on with climate. We see what’s going on with inequality and the struggle that so many people are facing around the world. So the challenge for us today is what can we do to go faster? How do we accelerate what we’re doing working together? Can we and should we do more? That is the question for this morning.”
                Are you a Giga-Guru?
                Project Gigaton is a Walmart initiative launched in 2017 to avoid 1 billion metric tons, or a gigaton, of greenhouse gases from the global value chain by 2030. Through Project Gigaton, suppliers can set goals for reducing emissions across six pillars—energy, waste, packaging (recycled content, recyclability, and optimization), agriculture, forests, and product use—and get recognition from Walmart for their progress.`],

                Tesco, Carlsberg Group, Unilever, L’OREAL, Mars, Dow, Chanel and Nestlé were just a few of the companies represented who shared their position on packaging sustainability. A primary message? Do something, now. As Gerald Rebitzer, Sustainability Director of Amcor said, “Perfect is the enemy of good” and we need to act now – even in small ways - to begin to see improvements. Legislation, consumer behavior, inadequate recycling collection and lack of end markets are all factors that may hinder the good intentions of sustainability efforts, but with climate change and oceanic waste undeniably present, there seemed to be unanimous agreement that small steps are better than none at all. Most brands who presented have 2025 targeted to implement sustainability changes.`,

        date: "11 | 04 | 2019",
        text: [
           `Typing ‘plastic’ into a search engine today will generate numerous articles describing its negative effect on the environment and actions being taken by government, retailers, food and drink producers, the packaging industry and consumers to address this issue. It is without question that action needs to be taken to address the plastic issue, while at the same time, other important sustainability issues, like climate change should not be ignored. In fact, in October 2018 the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) issued a special report on the impact of global warming and various steps we can take to reduce this.`,
           `While the problem of plastic pollution has been building up for years, only recently has it been thrust into our consciousness by David Attenborough’s Blue Planet II and many other news articles and media stories. Recent government rhetoric has heightened the ‘war on plastic’, spurred by consumers naturally reacting to images of plastic pollution, and demanding a quick response from industry and politicians.`,
           `This was exemplified in a move towards the end of last year which saw the Government launch a consultation to ban the sale and distribution of specific single-use plastic products, as part of a wider package of reforms to improve recycling and waste management. Elsewhere, retailers are also continuing to announce their dedication to a plastic-free cause. This was perhaps most recently apparent from Morrisons’ announcement of a paper bag trial for groceries, and a 50% increase in the cost of plastic bags.`,
           `Earlier last year, Lewis Hamilton, the F1 driver, made an emotional plea to the public to reduce its plastic consumption and help clear up our beaches. This has led to a huge focus on the UN sustainable development goal, ‘Life Below Water’. However, this needs to be addressed with consideration for the other goals, for example ‘Climate Action’.`,
           `When you consider packaging choices, we need to think of the bigger picture and not just focus on one aspect of the material. How packages are recycled after use for example, to prevent them from entering and damaging our ecosystem is of course a pertinent subject. But it’s also important for the conversation to contemplate the full life cycle of creating these materials, not just how they’re disposed of. Not taking a step back and seeing the broader picture, could lead to alternatives that are actually worse for the environment.`,
           `If we look back at our own heritage, in 1952, Dr. Ruben Rausing’s vision was to create a beverage carton package that would distribute food safely while only using a minimal amount of plastic. Even today, on average, 75% of the carton is made from paperboard from trees – a plant-based and renewable material. Because of this only a small amount of plastic needs to be used in beverage cartons. Coupled with this, using more renewable raw materials usually results in a smaller impact on climate change. In fact, lifecycle assessments show that cartons are the lowest climate impact solution for packaging in the vast majority of cases. While at the end of the lifecycle, cartons can be recycled and separated into a paperboard pulp and plastic and aluminium material streams, which can be made into new products such as new packaging, soap dispensers, napkin holders and plant pots.`,
           `If we look more broadly at reducing the impact of packaging on climate change, our collective industries will need to reduce their reliance on fossil-based plastic. Harnessing plant-based materials naturally decreases the reliance on the Earth’s finite natural resources and at the same time reduces impact on climate change. Increasingly we at Tetra Pak are using renewable plant-based materials to replace the fossil-based plastics used in beverage cartons such as plant-based polymers produced from sugar cane.`,
           `This shift in mindset towards how producers and retailers choose packaging is already happening. Belgium for example, has been able to achieve high rates of packaging collection and recycling through the use of extended producer responsibility as an effective legal mechanism for packaging waste collection and recycling. In the UK, a Thornton Budgens in North London has become the first supermarket in Britain to introduce a plastic-free zone, following Philip Hammond’s announcement in the Budget that he would introduce a tax on so-called virgin plastic. Waitrose is now selling tomatoes in punnets made with leaves and Iceland has an Indian microwave meal range packaged in plant-based paper pots rather than plastic food trays. Further afield, Coles is the first supermarket in Australia to transition to new packaging made from renewable plant materials using corn. If we look for inspiration from other industries, Lego has recently announced its plant-based building blocks have gone on sale, made from sugar-cane sourced plastic which is also recyclable. All of these innovations can be expected to reduce fossil-based plastic use, while at the same time reducing impact on climate change.`,
           `Charities and global organisations are also joining the fight. The Ellen MacArthur Foundation is a UK charity that is developing a new coalition of businesses and governments from across the globe to support a forward thinking set of circular economy commitments to tackling plastic waste.`,
           `Tetra Pak has seen a significant uptick in enquiries from customers looking for alternatives to fossil-based plastic and retailers are acting quickly on this issue. However, demonstrating an initial will to divert from the norm and use less fossil-based plastic is just the beginning. The challenge and risk lie with the industry making short-term switches from fossil-based plastics to controversial biodegradable plastics or other packaging types like glass or metal which can have a higher climate impact.`,
           `There is no simple answer to this problem and a focus on limiting plastic usage must be complemented by actions to address the overall environmental impact of packaging. This does not just apply to plastic. Tetra Pak is working in collaboration with many like-minded organisations across the value chain for all of our principal raw materials.  As a founding member of the Aluminium Stewardship Initiative (ASI), and ASI Certified, we aim to address sustainability topics related to aluminium at an industry level for the aluminium that we use in our ambiently distributed packages. Furthermore, having achieved full FSC™ Chain of Custody certification for all our operations[1], we can now supply FSC-labelled packages from anywhere in the world.`,
           `So, whether it’s the sourcing of raw materials, manufacturing process, distribution, recyclability or impact on climate change, all factors must be considered. Stakeholders must act now and where possible, establish sensible legal mechanisms to help support the recycling of low plastic, low climate impact packaging.`

            `Karen Moll, print and gift packaging buyer with Lush Fresh Handmade Cosmetics, and Patrick Keenan, packaging engineer at General Mills (who leads packaging R&D for the Annie’s brand), will be among expert panelists discussing recycled content at SPC Impact 2019 (Apr. 1-4, Seattle, WA), the leading sustainable packaging conference organized by the Sustainable Packaging Coalition. Taking place on Tues., Apr. 2, the “Knowledge Café: Scaling Recycled Content Adoption in Packaging” panel discussion will help demystify the world of recycled content.`,
            `Here, Moll and Keenan talk about lessons learned, ocean plastic, consumer education and more.`,
            `What was your biggest challenge to using recycled-content material in product packaging and how did you solve or overcome it?`,
            `Keenan: As a brand, there were two key areas that were a challenge to implementing recycled content:`,
            `1. Educating brand marketers on the value to a ‘’closed-loop system” so they could see the value in it; and`,
            `2. Finding a cost-effective, reliable and abundant supply of recycled materials. `,
            `Moll: The biggest challenge for me was just how resistant many of our print partners were to running 100% recycled paper. I heard a lot in my early days at Lush at how hard it was to get 100% recycled paper—how it would be too expensive, and when there were problems printing, it always came back to the properties of recycled material and we wouldn’t have these problems if it was virgin fiber paper. I’ve just had to be relentless in our requirements. It’s the line in the sand to do business with Lush and the suppliers who want to work with us find a way to get the 100% recycled paper and run it to our high standards.`, 
            `What lesson did you learn about incorporating recycled content in your packaging that you wish you had known before you started and why?`,
            `Moll: It was a bit of a black hole in terms of finding out who was producing 100% recycled paper and what grades existed. Different projects would come up out of the blue that had new paper requirements and then it was scrambling to find paper that worked.`,
            `I learned over time to partner with printers that understood our needs and were willing and open to including the mill in our paper discussions so both understood our vision and what we were trying to achieve. Over time I’ve been connecting more and more directly with the mills or reps to have these discussions but could have probably solved some heartache had I started those conversations earlier in my Lush career.`,
            `Keenan: Recycled-content packaging is like any new packaging material a brand is attempting to qualify.`,
            `There are many daunting hurdles that a brand needs to overcome to ensure that the packaging is safe for the consumer and does not impact the quality of the product. Tackling each concern one chunk at a time and qualifying it like any other packaging material makes it flow seamlessly through the process. `,
            `I have often heard companies in the packaging industry say that the brands aren’t willing to adopt recycled-content materials because of misconceptions around consumer beliefs with regards to appearance or concerns about the supply source. For our brand and consumers, this was/is non-existent, and I really want raw material suppliers and converters to understand that these minor visual defects or perceptions are actually not realized by consumers.`,
            `How important is it to explain to consumers how recycled-content packaging contributes to the business value of recycling? And how do you explain it to them?`,
            `Keenan: Did you know the back of a cereal box is the one of the most read packages? Annie’s Friends Cereal used the back of the box to highlight the benefit of recycled content [see photo at the top of this page]. We used a graphic of Bunny’s sorting their recycling and a game to pick out the types of materials. We used this to illustrate that by recycling these materials, they get reused into things like our cereal liner!`,
            `I also believe that there may be an industry-wide benefit to standardizing how we communicate recycled content using a similar approach as the How2Recycle Label to provide consistency to the consumer.`,
            `What do you most look for when sourcing packages with recycled content?`,
            `Keenan: Three things:`,
            `1. Lowering our overall “bunny footprint” while maintaining safe product. Bunny Footprint is how our brand communicates our overall carbon footprint, as our brand mascot Bernie is a bunny.`,
            `2. Being a leader in the industry and having a competitive advantage with differential packaging. `,
            `3. Educating consumers! `,
            `What characteristic about recycled-content packaging would you most like to improve and why?`,
            `Keenan: Four things:`,
            `1. Consumer understanding.`,
            `2. Access to materials.`,
            `3. A standard protocol for PCR verification.`,
            `4. Price and performance parity with virgin are key to driving acceptance. `,
            `Creating the ability to swap in and out of recycled content versus virgin seamlessly should be the end goal. `,
            `Moll: In terms of paper, I have no major complaints on any of the characteristics. There are going to be some inherent issues using recycled paper that we will probably never move away from. I’ve accepted that sometimes when we add certain finishes to the paper that there could be registration issues. But our suppliers have really exceeded expectations by working on running recycled paper to minimize any issues.`,
            `It can be challenging to bring on new suppliers that aren’t used to working with recycled paper. I wish it was more widely used so we can bring on new suppliers quicker with minimal problems.`,
            `When it comes to recycled content for plastic packaging, when does it make sense for brands to consider recycled ocean plastic and when does it not? `,
            `Keenan: This is a hot topic with our consumers. I think using any chance to educate consumer that a brand cares is a great way to build trust. Driving value for recycled content by including it in packaging drives up the price of recycled plastics and gives an incentive for people to collect plastic waste—thus helping to reduce ocean plastic. `,
            `So, either including actual ocean plastic or recycled content both are on the path to eliminating the problem.`

        title: "Artificial intelligence in packaging: CapQ vision inspection",
        date: "25 | 03 | 2019",
        text: [
            `AI's unique OEE performance-enhancing, high-speed boost reduces setup times, false rejections and scrap for full-surround cap inspection.`,
            `There’s more to the CapQ Vision Inspection system from Acquire Automation than meets the eye.`,
            `Sure, it’s capable of assessing capped beverage and consumer good containers using 360° inspection to check and confirm cap height, cap skew and raised or missing cap as well as the integrity of the tamper-evident band. And it also confirms that the correct color cap is on the packaged product while simultaneously inspecting for fill level.`,
            `Also, the 100% inspection detects errors early for quicker correction, minimizing the number of rejects, and by monitoring the filling process, CapQ also helps manufacturers conform to the requirements of 21CFR129.80  `,
            `And there’s the boilerplate features of stainless steel Nema 4X/IP65 enclosure, and the fact that it fits over an existing conveyor along with a height adjustability that feature ensures quick and easy integration into existing production lines.`,
            `But what sets it further apart from other vision systems and in fact nearly all other packaging systems is the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into the CapQ inspection process. AI enables the CapQ system to ignore water droplets and plastic fragment shedding that can skew measurement results, leading to false rejects. This software advancement and the easy-to-use operator touch screen interface make the CapQ system a pioneering quality inspection device.`,
            `Andrew Eddleman, product manager, responds to Packaging Digest’s questions specific to this leading-edge information processing technology.`,
            `Why use artificial intelligence?`,
            `Eddleman: Acquire was challenged by the market to innovate its high-performing cap inspection platform by reducing the false rejection results typically found in traditional machine inspection technology for beverage plants. Acquire responded to this challenge be exploring non-traditional machine vision technology—AI.  The AI technology, when combined with Acquires’ Spectrum platform software, creates a new technology, False Rejection Suppression Technology.  This enables the user to train in examples of product previously false rejected by machine vision and now properly and accurately inspect them—increasing overall line Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE), customer profits and scrap reduction.`,
            `What is the specific nature of AI?`,
            `Eddleman: We use AI technology to supplement our industry leading platforms and products. When AI is enabled, this allows for complicated data sets to be processed at high speeds (use cases above 1,000ppm). The usage of AI within our standard offerings reduces false rejection rates when compared to standard vision algorithms.`,
            `What’s the benefit for customers and operators?`,
            `Eddleman: There are three main benefits:`,
            `1. Uptime/Reliability /Overall Efficiency - Previous machine vision systems that might have failed due to product unpredictability or line changes can incorporate variability into the model. This leads to less false failures or false accepts and allows for more up time.`,
            `2. Faster setup time for new product variations even if the products presented are for the first time.`,
            `3. Faster updates to existing programs and recipes based on new line conditions.`,
            `What’s been the interest specific to the system’s AI capability?`,
            `Eddleman: The interest is in how this technology can handle deviations in product presentation or environmental items that typically cause high failure within traditional vision inspection solutions. Clients want to understand how this affects the bottom line and have been quite interested in the fast ROI of moving to an AI supplemented solution.`,
            `Also Acquire has always been a solution provider by combining intimate knowledge of the customers process and industry leading technology together. Our interest is in strengthening our position as technology leader by continuing to create new success stories at the same record pace in the packaging industry.  AI has been a part of this momentum for several years now and continues to solve vision applications where traditional machine vision may have limitations.`,
            `What’s a common question about AI that you’ve been asked?`,
            `Eddleman: Customer concerns especially within regulated industry is how to validate such a technology. This is addressed with the methods used in deployment. The system is programmed once before validation and the algorithm does not change after the system is installed. Our software is all under source-code control.`,
            `Another question is, what is AI capable of and how will it impact my inspection/quality program? Acquire has responded to this question by offering engineering evaluations either by using actual customer images, taking images, or creating a standard system for on-line evaluation at a customer’s plant.  From our years of experience these have been incredibly successful and added immediate proven value to the customer.`,
            `What further activity do you foresee for AI in your machinery or in packaging machinery in general?`,
            `Eddleman: We see an increased usage for AI technology to accomplish the following:`,
            `1. Removal of the uncertainty in manual inspection on applications that had previously not been possible;`,
            `2. Reduction of false rejection within manufacturers that currently experience a high false reduction rate (improvement of performance and efficiency);`,
            `3. Simplification of new product setup;`,
            `4. Increased flexibility in vision solutions to adapt to changing customer needs.`,
            `Anything else to point out?`,
            `Eddleman: This technology is ideal for defect detection, texture and material classification, assembly verification and deformed part location and character reading, including distorted print.`,
            `AI supplemented solutions learn by example—like that of a human. This means real-world conditions can be taught to the system. The cool part here is the system never forgets!  `

        title: "5 packaging trends emerging in 2019",
        date: "18 | 03 | 2019",
        text: [
            `In the ever-changing packaging industry, new styles come and go; consumers’ needs and desires shift and evolve; and brands are always on the lookout for a way to get ahead in their respective markets.`,
            `This will prove no less true in 2019, as evidenced by the various trends on the horizon for the packaging industry. Take a look at five predictable packaging movements and their drivers…`,
            `1. Flexibility`,
            `Flexible packaging has definitely come into its own in recent years. According to the Flexible Packaging Assn.’s report on the industry, flexibles accounted for 19% of the packaging materials market in the U.S. Much of this growth is due to material and production advancements. Today, environmentally-friendly plastics like compatibilized polyethylene and new end-of-life recycling initiatives have allowed flexible packaging’s popularity to multiply.`,
            `There are other reasons why flexible packaging is set to become more popular in 2019. Many are structurally designed to be easy for the customer to use, like being resealable. A pouch’s adaptable shape often makes it easy to carry and store. It also uses less material than rigid packaging, and its lighter weight helps reduce transportation and ecommerce costs. This source reduction lessens the overall impact on the environment.`,
            `2. Changes in ecommerce`,
            `It may come as no surprise that ecommerce will grow faster than ever in 2019. Many physical stores are failing (in November 2018, Sears announced its intention to close 40 more stores in February 2019), showing the extent to which ecommerce is dominating the marketplace.`,
            `As ecommerce becomes more popular, brands will have to try harder to stand out, and this is going to affect their packaging designs. In 2019, packaging will become far more personalized. We’ll begin to see more unusual packaging designs, whether they have an innovative gimmick added or are simply more eye-appealing.`,
            `Another factor in ecommerce packaging that will grow in importance this year is the amount of packaging that brands use. The total packaging material involved in a product will need to be carefully considered. Too much packaging will give the brand a reputation for being environmentally unfriendly, while too little packaging will make the brand seem generic or even cheap—and potentially allow too many products to get damaged during shipping.`,
            `3. Environmental awareness`,
            `Sustainable packaging has steadily become more important to consumers over the years—people are becoming overly conscious about their effect on our planet. Many brands have taken this into account and have changed their packaging accordingly, to great success. Examples of this include Seed Phytonutrients’ shower-friendly paper bottles.`,
            `Many brands are replacing non-recyclable plastics in their packaging with biodegradable alternatives like paper and hemp. Other materials that are becoming increasingly popular include more unusual ones, like fungi and algae.`,
            `Reducing or replacing materials in packaging can have a range of positive effects. For instance, using less materials will lower a product’s weight, which means it will require less energy to be transported and by extension will have a smaller carbon footprint. Using less materials also often results in lower production costs. Finally, using more commonly non-toxic biodegradable materials is likely safer for people and the environment. This is positive for both ecosystem and brand reputation.`,
            `4. Less is more`,
            `Stripping a package design down to its bare essentials has been a popular choice for a long time, particularly when minimalism was at the height of its popularity in the second half of the 20th century. Even now, the style is maintaining its relevance, and will continue to do so throughout 2019. This is partly due to minimalist styles being definitively linked with the reduction of materials. Not only does this cut production costs, but it also makes the brand image popular with environmentally aware consumers.`,
            `However, minimalism’s greatest strength in the modern age is its clarity. Consumers are more skeptical of what brands are trying to sell them than they once were; being bombarded with information will make them feel like brands are trying to distract them from a hidden catch.`,
            `On the other hand, if a product uses only a small amount of text to explain exactly what it contains, the resulting simplicity will imply transparency. This will reward the brand with increased consumer trust and, eventually, loyalty.`,
            `Of course, this does mean that more pressure will be placed on the remaining design elements to stand out from the competition. Therefore, effective use of color, empty space and original fonts will be paramount.`,
            `5. The power of nostalgia`,
            `Another style that many brands have used (and will continue to use) is that of vintage packaging.`,
            `To keep packaging innovative and modern, brands must be constantly aware of the changing styles in the industry and always looking out for up-and-coming trends. Failure to keep up with the competition will lead to packaging that comes across as dated and dreary.`,
            `Another option is to go to the other extreme: create packaging with a deliberately retro feel. This move has proven popular in recent years, particularly with food and drink products. Consumer approval of the style is rooted in nostalgia. It reminds consumers of their past, giving them a rose-tinted emotional response. Vintage packaging also has an air of authenticity—increased familiarity means the consumer will instinctively trust the product more than modern, unfamiliar designs.`,
            `It’s true that genuine innovation comes from creating something unique and novel. However, the risks associated with going down this route are often unnecessary. For many brands, vintage packaging will be a viable and potentially lucrative option. `

        date: "18 | 03 | 2019",
        text: [
            `Silicon Valley company has teamed up with boutique bike manufacturer Franco Bicycles to deliver the world’s first 3D printed, continuous carbon fiber single-piece unibody frame for a new line of eBikes Franco will sell under the Emery brand. The companies will showcase the new Emery ONE eBike at the Sea Otter Classic bicycling event in Monterey, California, April 11–14.`,
            `Arevo DNA technology is reportedly unique in the additive manufacturing (AM) world as it features patented software algorithms enabling generative design techniques, free-motion robotics for true 3D construction, and direct energy deposition for virtually void free construction all optimized for anisotropic composite materials.`,
            `Further, the unibody bike frame construction enabled by Arevo technology is said to be setting a new benchmark in high-performance bikes. The Arevo frame is made as a single part, in contrast to current composite frames, which are made of many parts glued together. With Arevo’s intelligent continuous carbon fiber placement, unprecedented structural integrity and stability are achieved.`,
            `Finally, the Arevo DNA AM process takes the design and final manufacture of a bike frame from 18 months to just a few days at a significant reduction in product development costs.`,
            `The frames are in production now at Arevo’s new multi-purpose facility in Milpitas and this achievement with the Emery ONE represents several breakthroughs for bicycle manufacturers, with implications for other industries as well. These breakthroughs include: true serial, volume production of AM-made composite parts that are made with thermoplastic materials, which are tougher, durable and recyclable, as compared to brittle and non-recyclable thermoset materials; A replacement of a laborious manual process with a fully-automated, “lights out” production model; delivering on the promise of localized manufacturing or on-shoring, which creates greater independence for bike brands; a much greater freedom of design for bike manufacturers that creates the possibility of fully-customized bikes made on an on-demand basis.`,
            `“We chose Arevo technology because its iterative and flexible design represents the new age in composites manufacturing, and we wanted to be the first bike company to help lead this revolution,” said Hector Rodriguez, Co-Founder of Emery Bikes. “Arevo’s continuous carbon fiber technology has been instrumental in achieving the ride quality and high-performance requirements we set out to accomplish with the Emery ONE.”`,
            `“This is the first composite additive-manufactured bike frame and it represents an important milestone for the AM industry as Arevo is delivering on the promise of on-demand manufacturing of composite parts in volume now,” said Hemant Bheda, Arevo Co-Founder and Chairman. “With the introduction of the Emery ONE, the transformation of the global composite bike industry has begun.”`,
            `Renowned industrial designer Bill Stephens of StudioWest collaborated with the Arevo and Franco teams to design the Emery ONEbike frame. “Arevo DNA offers a new paradigm for product designers, it forever changes how we can design and build anything,” said Stephens. “This technology allows us to push design boundaries in a way that was impossible until now. Arevo is changing the paradigm to ‘Manufacturing for Design.’”`

        date: "10 | 04 | 2019",
        text: [
            `Environmental advocacy group As You Sow (Oakland, CA) announced that it has withdrawn its shareholder proposals with Chevron and Phillips 66 since Chevron Phillips Chemical Co. (The Woodlands, TX), which is jointly owned by the two companies, has agreed to start reporting spills of pre-production plastic pellets. As You Sow reached a similar agreement with ExxonMobil last month. These pellets, also called nurdles, are believed to be a significant source of ocean plastic pollution, according to As You Sow.`,
            `As You Sow routinely files shareholder proposals with large corporations to, in its words, foster transparency. In the case of Chevron Phillips and other plastics producers, visibility “is essential to enable policy makers and other stakeholders to assess the scope of this growing problem [of plastic pellet spills],” said Senior Vice President Conrad MacKerron.`,
            `When As You Sow filed the shareholder proposal with Chevron and Phillips 66 calling for pellet spill reporting, the two companies petitioned the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to allow them to omit the proposal. The SEC did not rule in their favor and, consequently, Chevron Phillips will share the requested data with As You Sow. Chevron Phillips agreed to report data it currently submits to state regulatory agencies regarding:`,
            `The amount of pellets lost in the environment due to accidental releases from its plants;`,
            `the amount of material recovered within its resin-handling facilities that is recycled;`,
            `substantive information on its best management practices, plastic pellet production capacity and information on how it engages its supply chain to share best practices and help reduce and eliminate pellet losses elsewhere.`,
            `It also said it will employ third-party auditing to verify its reporting.`,
            `As Clare Goldsberry noted in a recent article about As You Sow’s advocacy, the plastics industry has a long-time program designed to deal with pellet spills and related issues. Operation Clean Sweep (OCS) was started 28 years ago by the Plastics Industry Association (PLASTICS) in cooperation with the American Chemistry Council to implement best practices to control pellet spills at resin manufacturing plants as well as plastics processing facilities. However, “Operation Clean Sweep provides no transparency on the scope and nature of spills or efforts made to clean up. Given what we know about the alarming rates of plastic leakage into oceans, companies can no longer hide behind vague pledges of best practices,” said MacKerron. “They need to provide prompt and detailed disclosure about specific actions taken to prevent spills, and when spills occur, information on spill size and actions taken to clean up.”`,
            `On April 3, Chevron Phillips Chemical announced that it was becoming a member of Operation Clean Sweep Blue. Also administered by PLASTICS and the American Chemistry Council, OCS Blue is an “even more rigorous commitment to pellet loss reduction efforts than Operation Clean Sweep, which the company has been a member of since its inception in 2000,” said Chevron Phillips Chemical in a press release.`,

        date: "10 | 04 | 2019",
        text: [
            `April 7, 2019, was World Health Day, an initiative of the World Health Organization designed to draw attention to the right for access to quality healthcare around the world. Materials supplier PolyOne Corp. (Avon Lake, OH) marked the occasion by announcing its successful collaboration with non-profit Global Vision 2020 (GV2020), which has the goal of bringing clear eyesight to more than one billion people living in extreme poverty. Since clinical trials began in 2016, the partnership has delivered correct-strength glasses to approximately 21,000 people in 21 countries, said PolyOne in a press release.`,
            `Designers Ian Akoro, Jane Spikowski and John Church of PolyOne’s IQ Design team donated their time and expertise to help Kevin White, Executive Director of GV2020, develop his invention, a diagnostic device called the USee. The PolyOne team worked on industrial design, ergonomics, manufacturability and material selection for the device in collaboration with White and toolmaker/molder Alpha Tool and Mold, a longtime PolyOne customer. The injection molded USee device includes a copolyester frame, medical-grade polycarbonate lenses and acetal for the dials and gears.`,
            `The device enables local volunteers trained as “refractionists” to assist patients, who turn dials on the USee to determine their own prescription. Volunteers then make a pair of snap-together, correct-strength eyeglasses on site, explained PolyOne. GV2020 calls it the “dial-snap-wear” method, and it takes about 15 minutes per person. The USee device is packaged within a kit that contains various strength lenses and conventional eyeglass frames.`,
            `White was motivated to bring corrective vision technology to developing economies while on international missions with the Marine Corps more than 14 years ago. “Why did I choose this particular issue? Because if left uncorrected, poor vision hinders education, limits prospects for employment, causes vehicular accidents and prevents individuals from attaining personal independence and prosperity. Clear sight is truly a life-changing gift,” said White.`,
            `“Working toward a solution to a world problem of this scale is in perfect alignment with PolyOne’s sustainability goals and commitment to our communities, both local and global,” said Cathy Dodd, Vice President, Marketing. “Through our design expertise, deep material science resources, and the energy and passion of our associates, PolyOne is well placed to help organizations such as GV2020 achieve their goals and make the world a better place to live.”`

        title: "Otter Products engineers ruggedized, reusable plastic ready-meals case",
        date: "10 | 04 | 2019",
        text: [
            `From manufacturing smartphone cases to other products, Otterbox protective solutions maker Otter Products (Fort Collins, CO) now sees a fresh opportunity in a different market: ready-meals transport packaging for ecommerce. Unlike corrugated boxes that dominate the ready-meal delivery landscape, the company’s new Liviri Fresh case is aligned in the direction of the sustainably-minded reusable, refillable system ala Loop (see Game-changing waste-free shopping platform introduced by TerraCycle at Davos, published January 2019).`,
            `Unlike Loop, Liviri Fresh is an open-platform approach that will customize and provide the reusable packaging to any ecommerce-delivered ready-meal company in the market.`,
            `There’s also a serious health concern to the introduction. In a Rutgers-Tennessee State University study in 2017, researchers who ordered 169 meal kits found that nearly 47% of 684 items ordered arrived with surface temperatures above 40 degrees, rendering them unsafe to consume.`,
            `The solution to that food safety problem is the 19.3 inch-long x 15.8-inch wide by 10.7-inch tall (with lid) Liviri Box that provides a total internal volume of 1,700 cubic inches or 29.4 quarts; the box weighs 12.5 lb.`,
            `Liviri Fresh is engineered to maintain a 3-day shelf life without using ice.`,
            `The boxes are nestable and stackable—40 empty units fit in the same space as 24 units full units. It is designed to maintain temperature for three days without ice or other coolant, though using dry ice provides nearly twice the delivery shelf life to increase the e-delivery options.`,
            `Kyle Fanning, Sr Product Line Manager, Otter Products, provides answers to PlasticsToday’s questions.`,
            `What is it made of and how is it molded and assembled?`,
            `Fanning: Liviri Fresh is made from an extensively-tested and proven grade of polypropylene that has surpassed all required standards for shipping containers. This polymer is recyclable, crack-proof, food grade and chemical resistant. Liviri Fresh boxes are injection molded and assembled in Michigan, utilizing a best-in-class automotive and industrial manufacturer for precision and quality.`,
            `What key factors went into design and development?`,
            `Fanning: We focused on achieving superior thermal performance—it keeps items in safe temperature range over 80% longer than the top-performing single-use insulation of 1.5-inch-thick recycled denim; durability to achieve up to 75 round trips through the small parcel network; a delightful user experience for both shipper and consumer; and a design-for-recyclability approach at end of life.`,
            `How was this size/volume determined?`,
            `Fanning: We dialed in the volume over the last year after detailed discussions with many potential customers. We settled on a size that works well as a medium-to-large box for most perishables shippers. It will comfortably fit the most common meal kit configuration of three meals for two people.`,
            `What is the nature of the “aerospace-grade insulation”?`,
            `Fanning: Vacuum insulated panels provide superior thermal performance over single-use insulation.`,
            `What is the cost of each and how many trips to reach ROI?`,
            `Fanning: Pricing is variable based on each customer’s unique needs. We’ll offer both purchase and lease options.`,
            `What was biggest challenge to development?`,
            `Fanning: Creating a product that was both optimized for the customers’ operations during pack out while still hassle-free for consumers. This version is a second-generation design—we poured all of our learnings from our pilot test first-generation design into our current version.`,
            `How complex was this to make compared to other Otterbox products?`,
            `Fanning: It’s a similar process to our ruggedized consumer coolers, so we have the expertise, but making it rugged enough for the small parcel network took significant design work and testing.`,
            `How is it returned? Where and how is it cleaned?`,
            `Fanning: The consumer places the included return label on the outside of the box and either sets it out for an auto-scheduled pickup or they can drop off at a shipping location. We have worked out a full cleaning protocol and we can either clean the units at one of our receiving facilities, or we’ll provide the customer with a turnkey approach (protocol and equipment) to do it themselves in their fulfillment centers.`,
            `What are the branding opportunities in terms of box decoration?`,
            `Fanning: Customers will have two custom branding decals prominently displayed on the box—one on the front and one on the lid.`,
            `Has a Life Cycle Assessment been done vs. standard meal-kit delivery packaging?`,
            `Fanning: We engaged a leading sustainability consultancy, thinkstep, to conduct a comparative LCA. They have submitted their draft LCA to an independent panel for the critical review process. The study will be complete and available in early April.`,
            `What’s the commercial status? Is any brand or retailer using or testing?`,
            `Fanning: We conducted a three-month pilot test during the summer of 2018 with two major brands who used our product to ship to their customers. We’re now in discussions with many target customers.`

        date: "05 | 04 | 2019",
        text: [
            `Plastic Energy Limited has reached an agreement with the province of West Java in Indonesia to build five chemical recycling plants. Plastic Energy uses patented thermal anaerobic conversion (TAC) technology to convert mixed stream end-of-life plastics such as polypropylene, polyethylene, and polystyrene into fuels.`,
            `The TAC process heats waste plastic in the absence of oxygen until it melts and the polymer molecules break down to form a rich, saturated hydrocarbon vapor. The condensable products are converted to hydrocarbon products while the non-condensable gases are collected separately and combusted to process energy. Raw diesel, light oil (naphtha) and synthetic gas components are collected. Naphtha and diesel can be stored and sold to the petrochemical industry to convert back into plastics or used as transportation fuels. Syngas is used to operate the plant.`,
            `The memorandum of understanding (MoU) signed by the Governor of West Java, Ridwan Kamil, follows campaigns – including the United Nations (UN) Clean Seas, the Global Plastic Action Partnership, and the Our Ocean Conference – to reduce plastic pollution and, in particular, plastics reaching the ocean around Indonesia, a country which is second only to China for leaking plastic into the sea (see graphic).`,
            `The Indonesian government has made addressing the plastic waste issue a priority, with an ambitious commitment to reduce marine plastic debris by 70 percent by 2025.`,
            `he waste management industry in Indonesia is still in its early stages of development, and as such infrastructure development still faces a range of challenges. Plastic Energy is exploring partnerships with a range of public and private sector organizations to address these challenges and to facilitate the construction of these plants, and to make West Java a showcase for the rest of Indonesia.`,
            `Governor Ridwan Kamil commented: “West Java is the largest province in Indonesia in terms of population. We have 50 million people and 27 cities. West Java is also known as the province with a vision of green development, and are creating a series of strategies to make sure our future is sustainable. One of the big issues we are facing is plastic waste. So, therefore, I am very happy to sign this MoU with Plastic Energy, a British company that can transform plastic waste into fuel, something which is very useful. We are committed to ensuring this project is executed in a proper, transparent and professional way. We want to be the first region in Indonesia to have the facilities to transform plastic waste into energy and into fuel, through this partnership with Plastic Energy.”`,
            `Carlos Monreal, Founder and CEO of Plastic Energy commented: “We are delighted to be able to make a significant contribution to Indonesia’s battle to reduce plastic pollution. Through the introduction of these plants, we will give value to plastic waste which is usually sent to landfill and sometimes mismanaged which leads to the pollution of the ocean.”`,
            `Plastic Energy has two industrial plants which have been operational for more than three years in Spain and earlier this year reached an MoU agreement with Sabic to provide feedstock for the production of certified circular polymers, following the establishment of a commercial plant in the Netherlands.`

        title: "Driving Supply Chain Sustainability with Blockchain",
        date: "02 | 05 | 2019",
        text: [
           `Blockchain can accelerate a transition from owning to sharing`,
           `Sustainability is one of the defining issues of our time.`,
           `Businesses are overhauling the way they source, create and distribute products to build a sustainable future.`,
           `Sustainability affects everything a business does, including how it works with its suppliers. But too many supply chain managers employ a “take-make-waste” mentality.`,
           `As a result, supply chains around the globe remain fraught with inefficiencies due to wasteful use of assets. But there’s a solution at our fingertips: blockchain.`,
           `Blockchain can transition supply chain management to a sharing economy where people and companies reduce waste and decouple growth from the consumption of finite resources - thus becoming more sustainable and profitable at the same time.`,
           `The power of blockchain`,
           `To appreciate the power of blockchain, it’s important to fully understand the technology. Blockchain is a secure electronic ledger that enables multiple parties to distribute data - but not copy it.`,
           `The ledger creates an unchangeable record of transactions among multiple parties. Each record is time-stamped and linked to the previous one. Each digital record or transaction in the thread is called a block. The thread allows either an open or controlled set of users to participate in the electronic ledger.`,
           `Put another way, blockchain allows disparate users to make transactions - and then creates an unchangeable record of those transactions. Adopting blockchain technology supports more distributed, cheaper and faster ways for people and businesses to share transactional information securely.`,
           `Businesses are already incorporating blockchain into supply chain management. For instance, Vinsent provides a blockchain-based platform that makes it possible for wineries and wine lovers to connect directly and sell and buy wine months after harvest.`,
           `Vinsent uses blockchain along the entire supply chain. For example, blockchain is used to record the purchase of a bottle of wine, and blockchain empowers everyone in the process to track the creation of the wine from casking to bottling.`,
           `Blockchain for Wine? Meet the (Gliding Eagle) Entrepreneur Making it Happen (look, listen, and learn from the video above)`,
           `As for other examples:`,
           `Walmart partners with IBM to use blockchain to track the delivery of perishable products along the supply chain.`,
           `BHP Billiton, the world’s largest mining firm, uses blockchain to improve its supply chain processes.`,
           `Blockchain is a foundational technology that powers a shift from owning to sharing assets. It’s as foundational and impactful as the internet itself.`,
           `Granted, there are doubters. Major foundational shifts always have their doubters.`,
           `The internet did. The cloud did. And so does mobile.`,
           `But just to give you a sense of blockchain’s impact, let’s look at how blockchain can accelerate this transition from owning to sharing.`,
           `Why sharing?`,
           `Right now, owners of logistics equipment have visibility into the utilization rates of their assets. Asset owners in different organizations are unable to view each other’s assets, however.`,
           `If an asset owner needs more equipment, they can either purchase more or rent from dealers and manufacturers - a manual and painful process (more phone calls, more paper).`,
           `But in a sharing economy powered by blockchain, individuals have visibility into the availability of all unused logistics assets (trucks, trailers, construction equipment, warehouse capacity). Instead of expecting customers to own and maintain fleets of logistics equipment, businesses can scale their capacity on demand. In other words, people have access to ownership instead of being owners outright.`,
           `If everyone has a clear line of sight into which asset is being used when - and there is a global, decentralized, immutable ledger that provides visibility into how participants in the supply chain can share each other’s assets - people will buy fewer assets and better utilize their current resources.`,
           `The X factor: TRUST`,
           `This dramatic evolution will happen because blockchain makes it easier for businesses in the supply chain to share assets with each other (rather than buy them outright) by bypassing a central, governing authority.`,
           `In a sharing economy powered by blockchain, customers no longer have to go through dealers and manufacturers to scale their fleet. In short, they no longer have to go through the middle man.`,
           `Blockchain fosters trust in the supply chain because the secure ledger cannot be changed by actors in the supply chain. With blockchain, people have direct visibility into the health of an asset, its maintenance history, and users.`,
           `People also have visibility into the characteristics of those renting and sharing assets through ratings and reviews stored on the blockchain.`,
           `That trust makes it possible for people to do radically new things along the supply chain such as creating smart contracts, programming money and creating a digital property.`,
           `But I also see some less obvious but important impacts of a sharing economy fueled by blockchain. For instance, consider what would happen if a business owns fewer assets.`,
           `The people in charge of managing assets have more time to learn new skills to make the supply chain more effective. The workforce can become more nimble and responsive to change.`,
           `Next steps (Running Blockchain Pilots for Your Supply Chain)`,
           `Perhaps you are already using blockchain to improve your supply chain. Perhaps you’re just exploring the technology.`,
           `Whatever you do, start testing and learning. Consider getting started by testing how blockchain could make just one aspect of the supply chain transition from ownership to sharing. - run a blockchain pilot!`,
           `Fortunately, tools such as design sprints can help you test and learn.`,
           `With a design sprint, cross-functional teams develop hypotheses for specific customer solutions. And then the team develops a rough prototype tested against feedback from real customers.`,
           `The need to be sustainable is only going to increase. With blockchain, supply chain management can play a vital role in addressing this need.`,
           `It’s up to players in the supply chain to test and learn now.`,

        title: "Sustainable innovations in flexible packaging",
        date: "23 | 04 | 2019",
        text: [
           `According to the “2019 Flexible Packaging Assessment Report” by PMMI Business Intelligence, the continued trend for sustainable options has influenced the flexible packaging market through various methods such as 3D printing, and the use of new stains and films.`,
           `3D printing:`,
           `1. Decreases cost through significantly cheaper molds.`,
           `2. Packaging with eco-friendly and lightweight materials.`,
           `3. Small batch production enables a faster route to market.`,
           `4. Reduces flexible plastic waste pollution by re-using materials.`,
           `Stains:`,
           `New stains in flexible packaging film facilitate package breakdown (well after the end of the product shelf life), which helps the plastic degrade much faster in landfills.`,
           `Films:`,
           `1. Compostable starch-based and biodegradable films.`,
           `2. Consolidation to fewer films to maximize scale in order quantities.`,
           `Another method of extending the flexible packaging life cycle is to reduce the carbon footprint of packaged goods throughout the supply chain, shifting the focus from material type to packaging that uses less material. Retailers such as Costco are encouraging manufacturers to maximize warehouse space by lessening package waste, while consumers are watchful for “poorly produced, over-packaged, or non-eco substrates that package their goods.”`,

        title: "Shippers face many challenges in successfully delivering products to end-users, and last mile logistics will be a core focus of change in the coming months.",
        date: "30 | 04 | 2019",
        text: [
           `Same-Day Delivery and Last-Mile Logistics`,
           `Consumer demands and expectations are rising, and up to 25 percent of consumers are willing to pay extra for same-day delivery.`,
           `Also, same-day delivery will reach a 25-percent market share by 2025.`,
           `By 2018 alone, same-day delivery and last mile logistics will be valued at more than $1.35 billion.`,
           `E-commerce is the driving force behind the sudden uptick in last-mile logistics, and as explained by Logistics Management, e-commerce is expected to grow to $2.4 trillion by 2018 as well.`,
           `Furthermore, the significance of real-time data analytics is proving to be a major contributor to implementing last-mile delivery as detailed by Matthias Winkenbach, Ph.D., director of the MIT Megacity Logistics Lab.`,
           `To gain a competitive advantage in last-mile logistics, shippers need to understand the top seven trends in last mile logistics.`,
           `1. Last Mile Logistics Gets Faster Fulfillment`,
           `Fulfillment timetables are changing. Consumers want faster fulfillment, and shippers need to move more product at a faster pace.`,
           `Shipments that previously required one hour to process are now being forced into three-minute intervals, if not faster times.`,
           `Consequently, last mile logistics is finally in a position to become part of this push toward faster fulfillment.`,
           `Among millennials, consumers are willing to pay a premium up to 30-percent more for same-day delivery, reports McKinsey & Company, with an overwhelming majority willing to pay extra for guaranteed delivery, on second picture.`,
           `Paired with the sudden spike in parcel delivery, last mile delivery will continue to grow 10-percent annually.`,
           `2. Supply Chain Disruptors Impact Last Mile Logistics`,
           `Supply chain disruptors, such as venture capitalist start-ups, previously discussed in the Uberization of Trucking, are also impacting last mile logistics. Up to 84 percent of global freight spend on trucking costs, including fuel, labor, technology and asset tracking, amounting to more than $800 in the industry.`,
           `According to Supply Chain 24/7 (via Business Insider), Amazon is already well on its way to creating and managing its comparable Uber-like app for trucking. Unfortunately, the tech landscape is riddled with cases of supply chain disruptors failing, but the trend is clear and shows little indication of regression.`,
           `3. Shippers Turn to Smart Tech for Tracking`,
           `The use of Uber-like apps implies another impact and trend in last-mile logistics, the use of smart technology for tracking purposes. Through the Internet of Things (IoT), smart technology and sensors can successfully track shipments in real time. Consumers and shippers can both receive SMS alerts, email notifications and even Google notifications for every movement a shipment makes.`,
           `Combined with the upcoming electronic logging devices (ELD) mandate, the use of smart tech to track last mile logistics will grow.`,
           `4. Analytics Will Drive Last Mile Logistics Costs Down`,
           `The amount of information coming from automated systems and smart technology can have another purpose when applied through analytics. Analytics allow supply chain entities to isolate the cost-impacting factors across all shipments. Although subtle changes may not have a major impact on initial costs, data analytics provide a means of pushing costs to infinitesimal limits.`,
           `As a result, the overall costs of last mile delivery can be pushed further down, encouraging more consumers to use same-day delivery and faster delivery options.`,
           `5. Insourcing Reaches Into Last Mile Logistics`,
           `Outsourcing seems to be the topic of the year, especially among companies providing third-party logistics (3PL) services.`,
           `However, the sudden spike in last mile delivery encourages more shippers to begin insourcing last mile deliveries. In other words, shippers are using their trucks to reach their immediate, local consumers. Yet, 90 percent of shippers have fewer than six trucks, so outsourcing may be necessary for increasing shippers’ last mile delivery options.`,
           `6. Autonomous Vehicles and Trucks (AVs and AT), Drones and Robotic Delivery Grow More Important`,
           `AVs and ATs, otherwise known as self-driving vehicles or trucks, will impact last mile logistics as well. Self-driving vehicles, drones, and robots will become key to increasing last mile delivery options, while maintaining high reliability and same-day delivery, in both rural and urban areas.`,
           `However, existing regulations around the trucking industry are not likely to enable wide-scale implementation of driverless delivery options within the next two years.`,
           `7. Drivers Become Merchants`,
           `Shippers need to find ways to reach more shoppers and convert them into consumers. While up to 65 percent of all purchases use the internet for research purposes before making a purchase, putting information and product in front of consumers remains the strongest way to encourage this conversion.`,
           `In conjunction with faster, better technology, including driverless trucks, the role of the driver will evolve. Drivers will become merchants, selling items from trucks, but there are several challenges shippers face in accessing this new resource, reports Susie Walker of Veriship. These include the following:`,
           `1. Who assumes the burden of risk for merchandise that has not been paid for?`,
           `2. What happens if consumers wish to return merchandise purchased from drivers?`,
           `3. How will drivers process payments and handle their accounting?`,
           `4. Will there be a charge per transaction to the original shipper?`,
           `5. In interstate or international shipping regulations, who will be listed as the official owner of the merchandise being sold by drivers?`,
           `The Last Mile Logistics Revolution Is Coming: Are You Prepared?`,
           `Exciting things are happening in last-mile logistics, and the level of technology leveraged to push the frontiers of last mile delivery and same-day delivery is growing in complexity and scope.`,
           `Shippers must take note of the trend in last-mile logistics today, or they face losing their competitive advantage, especially with e-commerce giants, like Amazon, Walmart, and Target, moving toward instant delivery as part of last mile logistics.`,
           `How will your organization prepare to handle the growing complexity of the rising demand for more last mile logistics deliveries by consumers?`

        title: "Brand Owners Must Communicate Environmental Benefits of Flexible Packaging",
        date: "16 | 04 | 2019",
        text: [
           `The Flexible Packaging Association (FPA) illustrates why brand owners need to more effectively communicate the environmental benefits of flexible packaging to consumers in the infographic below. `,
           `The infographic helps to summarize the new FPA sustainability report, "Perspectives on the Meaning of Sustainability in Flexible Packaging." The report explores how flexible packaging lends itself to brand owners’ ability to establish a reputation for environmental stewardship. FPA conducted a 2018 sustainability study to better understand perspectives on sustainability and packaging among both consumers and brand owners. The study integrates insights from brand owners surveyed online in June 2018 by Packaging World and insights from an online survey of U.S. consumers conducted by The Harris Poll in July 2018.`,
           `The survey results indicate that consumers are already talking about sustainability, but there’s still an opportunity to inject specific sustainable manufacturing processes and supply chain concepts into the conversation. That’s where brand owners come in.`,
           `Although consumers are most likely to associate sustainability with familiar terms like “renewable” (59 percent) and “recyclable" (56 percent), some recognize the importance of business-to-business (B2B) terms like “transportation efficiency” (24 percent) and “circular economy” (13 percent) when presented with them. Twenty-four percent of consumers say, transportation efficiency describes sustainability, while 81 percent think it’s at least somewhat important that product packaging has been transported efficiently.`,
           `The beneficial lifecycle impacts and sustainability advantages of flexible packaging are more likely to resonate with consumer ages 18-44, who represent the next wave of buying power in the U.S. Brand owners who promote these messages can take advantage of the opportunity.`,
           `Younger generations are more likely than members of older generations to believe flexible packaging is sustainable, and are less likely than older generations to think glass or corrugated are sustainable. Millennial consumers ages 18-34 are more likely than older consumers to say they support/buy from businesses with sustainability initiatives.`,
           `Brand owners in general are in tune with consumers’ viewpoints of sustainability, yet disagree on their understanding of the concept. This skepticism on behalf of brand owners suggests an opportunity to inform consumers on the complete picture of sustainability.`,
           `Eighty-three percent of consumers say they understand the meaning of sustainability, but 60 percent of brand owners think consumers understand the meaning of sustainability.`

        text: [
           `“You eat with your eyes first!” It is true, and it is hardwired into our brain. Anything that looks beautiful is appealing to our eyes, as well as other senses. This also applies to product packaging.`,
           `Packaging and labeling are essential for product identification and awareness, of course. They provide customers product information, such as ingredients, nutritional facts, volume and best-before dates. But they also play an ultra-important role in marketing by enhancing the products’ appearance for promoting them to the prospective customers. After all, a memorable presentation can make customers return to the brand again and again.`,
           `In fact, it helps to create a customer’s relationship with a brand with some functional and emotional content, such as information related to preserving its contents or something that makes the product celebratory, aspirational or proud to own or gift. Think of a Starbucks signature cup or the unique bottle of your favorite liquor or perfume.`,
           `Packaging success = marketing impact`,
           `The innovation and execution excellence of packaging and labeling has always been an integral part of any famous and successful marketing program. Don’t believe us? Consider some of these examples:`,
           `• Coca-Cola’s “Share a Coke” campaign used packaging to build a relationship between the brand’s identity and consumers’ personal identity by emblazoning first names on their cans and bottles.`,
           `• Casper put its mattresses in a box “the size of a dorm refrigerator” not just to cut their shipping costs, but also to “disrupt the mattress industry” by allowing people to test the mattress in their homes with a “free” 100 days return policy.`,
           `• The packaging of “five,” a subline by Häagen-Dazs is again a smart marketing move where the  brand prominently listed five core ingredients on the front of the package to showcase its premium-ness and pure goodness.`,
           `Apart from these three examples, many others prove that packaging plays a great role in the supply chain—it has to perform selling functions and earn a product consideration to drive revenue. It is a core business driver that enhances the consumer experience by building a personal connection between the product and buyers.`,
           `Let’s look at the role packaging and labeling plays in the marketing of a product.`,
           `1. To provide information to customers.`,
           `Giving the right information to the right people at the right time lies at the core of every marketing campaign. And that’s exactly the role packaging plays. This is especially true for new products launches, where product information plays a crucial role in market penetration. With the help of packaging and labeling, marketers can give essential information—such as how to use a technology device; how to cook or store food; procedures and precautions to take during product usage; and so on. In short, it gives the detailed information that you can’t cover in 20-second-long ads.`,
           `In today’s world where people are more comfortable shopping at supermarkets, it is next to impossible to have a salesman for each customer. Your packaging is one of your most powerful tools to convey the information to the customer. Consider how Maggi or any other ready-to-cook food uses packaging not only to give information about how to cook them but also additional information about the beneficial nutrition found in them. Besides, giving some extra information never hurts you; in fact, it does quite the opposite.`,
           `You can use your packaging information to safeguard your company. While it is true that you can’t give all the information about your product in a 20-second-long ad, what if someone sues you for information not provided? You are safe as long as the information is printed on the packet. This means, you can raise your hands, simply stating that the information was already provided and it isn’t your fault if the consumer failed to read it.`,
           `2. To showcase your sustainability.`,
           `Marketing sustainability is the “in thing.” In simple words, it refers to businesses that use environmentally friendly production, sourcing and distribution practices. And it’s no fad, as there are marketing advantages. According to a global survey by Nielsen, “66% of all consumers will pay more for sustainable brands.” The survey also found that Millennials are more willing to pay more for products that have a minimal or positive impact on the environment.`,
           `There is a reason why more and more businesses are opting for sustainable packaging across the world. A survey by Goldstein Research found that, in 2016, the global green packaging market reached (US)$139.09 billion. Moreover, it is expected to cross $230.19 billion in 2024, showing a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 6.5% between 2016 and 2024.`,
            `Thus, biodegradable molded fiber is gaining rapid commercial importance in the packaging industry and is one good way to show your customers you care.`,
            `What more? Consumers are not just ready to buy something that’s environmentally friendly but are also willing to pay more for it.`,
            `3. To extend your brand image.`,
            `What comes to your mind when someone mentions Tiffany’s? Of course, its beautiful robin’s egg blue boxes. The same goes for Absolut Vodka, known for its round bottle since its launch in 1979. Although the new bottle has been updated with a new script, two-line logo, a redesigned medallion, a new brand signifier and reduced glass weight, the company has never changed the shape of the original bottle, which has become synonymous to the brand.`,
            `The packaging is responsible for the product’s brand image and brand recognition. This, in turn, also reflects the image of the company. Think Ferrero Rocher. The moment you see these brown and gold covered packages, you think about the mouth-watering chocolates inside, you think of Ferrero Rocher.`,
            ``,
            `The role of packaging in marketing is best described as the marriage between form and functionality, whose sole purpose is to entice customers not only to buy the products but also to come back for more. It can even become synonymous to your brand’s image, as it helps to grab the attention of your target audience, apart from functioning as a tool for convenience and information transmission.`,
            `It is therefore essential to consider every aspect of your product packaging so that it creates the most profitable impact.`

        date: "05 | 05 | 2019",
        text: [
          `Nestlé USA packaging sustainability manager Walt Peterson discusses the pathway to make 100% of the company’s packaging recyclable or reusable by 2025, with a focus on avoiding plastic waste.`,
          `2019 has already been a banner year for the introduction of ambitious sustainable packaging initiatives, programs and collaborations with major brands playing a prominent role. Exemplary of these is Nestlé, which in mid-January laid out its vision and plans for accelerating the global packaged food provider’s sustainable packaging goals. Some highlights include:`,
          `• Starting in February 2019, Nestlé will begin to eliminate all plastic straws from its products, using alternative materials like paper as well as innovative designs to reduce littering.`,
          `• Nestlé will also start rolling out paper packaging for Nesquik in the first quarter of 2019 and for the Yes! snack bar in the second half of 2019. Smarties will start rolling out plastic-free packaging in 2019 and Milo will introduce paper-based pouches in 2020.`,
          `• Nestlé Waters will increase the recycled PET content of its bottles to 35% by 2025 at the global level and will reach 50% in the United States and Nestlé Waters will increase the recycled PET content for its European brands to 50% by 2025.`,
          `• Nestlé Institute of Packaging Sciences (shown in the picture above) is exploring new paper-based materials and biodegradable/compostable polymers that are also recyclable, among other alternatives. This could become a valuable option in places where recycling infrastructure does not yet exist and will not be available for some time.`,
          `• Nestlé initiated a collaboration with PureCycle Technologies to produce food-grade recycled polypropylene (PP) from plastic waste feedstock.`,
          `The press release is posted at the company website: Nestlé accelerates action to tackle plastic waste.`,
          `One of the company's visionaries in these initiatives, Walt Peterson, manager – packaging sustainability, Nestlé USA, responds to Packaging Digest’s questions.`,
          `Which of these initiatives holds the most promise of making an impact short term? Which over the longer term?`,
          `Peterson: Our vision is that none of our product packaging, including plastics, should end up in landfill or as litter, including in seas, oceans and waterways. To achieve this, our ambition is that 100% of our packaging is reusable or recyclable by 2025.`,
          `We have a large portfolio of our packaging that is already recyclable in the U.S. In the short term, Nestlé will continue to play an active role in the development of well-functioning collection, sorting and recycling systems. In the U.S., Nestlé is involved with the Materials Recovery For the Future (MRFF) project, whose vision is simple: flexible packaging is recycled curbside and the recovery community captures value from it. After several years of research exploring cutting edge sorting equipment for recycling facilities and end markets for material, the project is conducting a pilot to demonstrate the technical and economic feasibility of including flexible packaging in a single-stream curbside recycling system. Results are forthcoming in 2019.`,
          `We are also providing more information on how to recycle our products on-pack, in partnership with the How2Recycle program.`,
          `Over the long term, we are exploring novel packaging solutions through the Nestlé Institute of Packaging Sciences. The Institute will evaluate and develop various sustainable packaging materials and closely collaborate with industry partners.`,
          `What can you say about the participation in the Loop reusable-packaging-based program?`,
          `Peterson: Nestlé is expanding its global efforts to develop new packaging solutions, minimize its impact on the environment and protect the planet for future generations. Loop fits into those efforts by taking an innovative and disruptive approach to changing how products are packaged—and delivered—and how consumers enjoy them. It’s just one way Nestlé is innovating and transforming its business with sustainability in mind while still providing consumers a premium product experience.
          Companies are looking for new ways to address packaging and reduce waste--and consumers are demanding it. Loop is an example of how the industry is responding to that and we believe consumers will be very interested in trying it out for themselves.`

          ` Recycling is good for the environment and for business, according to a new resource published by NACS and the Can Manufacturers Institute (CMI).`,
          `The new resource, “The Value of Can and Bottle Recycling,” offers tips for improving current practices, how to communicate the program goals to staff and customers, and a checklist to help retailers reduce contamination in their recycling bins.`,
          `“NACS consumer surveys reveal that 70 percent of c-store customers say they empty out their vehicles while filling up at the pump, oftentimes placing recyclable materials like beverage cans and bottles in regular trash bins,” said Carolyn Schnare, NACS director of strategic initiatives. “This new resource provides guidance that can help our industry convey to their customers what to recycle and the value of doing so, as well as to improve the likelihood that customers will recycle cans and bottles appropriately.”`,
          `“Consumers want to be good environmental stewards,” said CMI President Robert Budway, “And, having the ability to recycle aluminum beverage packaging away from home is a win-win for can manufacturers, convenience stores and consumers. We believe that increasing away from home recycling of aluminum cans will benefit the entire recycling system.”`,
          `Convenience stores serve an estimated 165 million customers daily — including the 40 million who fill up their vehicles. Per NACS consumer surveys, more than half of convenience store customers (53 percent) say that they’d like to see more recycling bins at their local c-store, providing an opportunity for the industry to enhance current recycling practices. `,
          `Waste management and recycling programs at convenience stores can also help ensure that trash is collected and/or recycled and does not become litter. Consumers have regularly cited litter as the top reason for opposing new store builds in their community, and cans and bottles account for one-third of items littered outside of a convenience store.`,
          `The new resource provides information on the benefits of recycling, steps to help improve recycling at c-stores and additional tools and resources available through NACS and CMI.`

          `The Institute of Scrap Recycling Industries (ISRI) names Nestlé Waters North America as its 2019 Design for Recycling® (DFR) Award winner, in recognition of its innovative use of recycled plastic and its product design centered on recycling.`,
          `The DFR Award is ISRI's most prestigious award given annually to the most innovative contribution to products designed with recycling in mind. Nestlé Waters has received the award specifically for the design of its Nestlé Pure Life 700 ml bottle made from 100 percent recycled PET plastic (rPET).`,
          `"The Design for Recycling Award recognizes proactive steps made by manufacturers that have actively incorporated its principles into products and processes," said Robin Wiener, president of ISRI. "Through innovative thought and design, Nestlé Waters is demonstrating the positive value of recycled plastics. There are obvious invaluable environmental benefits to using recycled plastics as feedstock in the manufacturing process to which Nestlé Waters has shown a commitment. On top of that, the design of the labeling process also takes into account improving the quality of the recycling stream. Through every stage of the manufacturing process, Nestlé Waters has shown a clear dedication to designing for recycling, and it is an honor to present them with this year's award."`,
          `In addition to the Nestlé Pure Life bottle being made entirely from recycled content, its design also takes into account end-of-life processing: The bottle features a state-of-the-art, pressure-sensitive label. Unlike traditional adhesive labels that may not release from the PET flakes during the recycling process, these new labels will release easily during the wash stage of the recycling process so the material can be used to make new bottles again and again.`,
          `Nestlé Waters North America has been incorporating recycled plastic into its packaging since 2011. Most recently, the company also announced that it is on track to nearly quadruple its use of recycled PET plastic (rPET) in less than 3 years, with an ambition to reach 50 percent recycled plastic across its U.S. domestic portfolio by 2025.`

          `Benefits of high performance films include product transparency, extended shelf life and enhanced flavors. According to the “2019 Flexible Packaging Assessment Report” by PMMI Business Intelligence, manufacturers use these films because they desire thinner materials that don’t compromise the overall barrier, functional properties, or strength of the package.`,
          `Demand is growing for transparent barrier films that can replace the aluminum foils currently used on laminate structures, allowing the product to be seen. Also, items that were formerly packaged in rigid containers are transitioning to high quality flexible packaging, such as microwave-compatible pouches.`,
          `These improvements in the barrier properties of clear plastic films attribute to flexible packaging’s ongoing replacement of glass and metal packages, particularly retort and hot-filled product packaging.`,
          `Companies who participated in the report also mentioned modified atmosphere packaging (MAP) when looking to extend shelf life of perishable fresh produce such as fruits, vegetables, and flowers. MAP modifies the atmosphere food is packaged in, to reduce spoilage and increase shelf life without using additives. Coupled with high performance films, MAP provides manufacturers excellent mechanical strength and chemical resistance against the growth of bacteria. MAP is also useful for packaged foods such as meat and baked goods.`

        date: "01 | 05 | 2019",
        text: [
            `By Matt Reynolds, Editor`,
            `“The slowdown is real, it’s happening all around the world, it’s coming to our shores, and in some segments of the economy, it’s here already,” says Alex Chausovsky, Director of Speaking Services, ITR Economics. “Despite the good feeling, the strong customer orders, and the positive momentum, that mindset that you had from 2018 needs to change to a more conservative one, a more defensive one, and for slower growth in the U.S. economy overall.”`,
            `Growth will continue, of course, but it's going to feel slower compared to 2018. The growth for 2019 is expected to land around 0.9% GDP, relative to a 3+% growth for 2018. Chausovsky said this isn’t unexpected, given our decade-plus of nearly unprecedented expansion after the great recession market correction event of 2008. And even more recently, the recent continued expansion of GDP over the past two and a half years have been, in themselves, remarkable developments, though perhaps artificial due to a short-term tax reform that looks to experts like Chausovsky to be far more expensive than helpful when perceived via a longer view.`,
            `“The passing of the tax reform bill of 2017 added about six to nine months of acceleration to the usual U.S. economic business cycle,” he says. “But that boost, that injection of stimulus we gave ourselves, has ended. We’ve reached the back side of the cycle and we’re not expecting to see the benefits of tax reform any further of 2019.”`,
            `So according to ITR, the U.S. economy has peaked in terms of ITR space within the usual 2- to 4-year cycle. The good news, however, is that the impending slowdown isn’t expected to be particularly significant, it is only expected to feel different than the recent artificially-supported boom years. And after the mild slowdown, another rising trend is predicted in 2020 to 2021.`, 
            `Further, these trend lines are expected fluctuations; now is the time for manufacturers to settled down and catch their breaths after the recent expansion.`,
            `“How do you position yourself right now to capitalize on that next rising trend, in 2020 and into 2021?” Chausovsky asks. “Do you have the right people? Do you have the right capacity? Do you have the right resources in place? And if not, what can you do now, during this comparative lull, to position yourself to take advantage of the opportunity that will be available during that next rising trend?”`,
            `It bears mention that not all sectors will bounce back the same. If the great recession of 2008 is any indicator (and it is a classic case to be heeded, according to Chausovsky), U.S. manufacturing doesn’t enjoy the same degree of bounce-back that may exist at the consumer level. Near record employment means people have jobs, have expendable income, and the lion’s share of the economy is just that, end consumers consuming. But the industrial economy is not the same as the consumer economy. B2B and manufacturing upstream of Joe Schmoe on the street may have a more tepid relief from the impending malaise, just as it has since 2008. Data now shows that in the portion of 2020, the first 2 to 3 quarters, upstream manufacturing sectors will actually drop into negative territory, the textbook definition of a recession (albeit brief).`,
            `“Essentially, the slowdown will be felt more acutely by manufacturing and B2B, and more acutely the further removed from the end-consumer,” Chausovsky says.`,
            `Bottom line? When you think about deploying capital on your own resources, your promotions and your marketing efforts, understand that while the consumer-facing economy might not feel much of a blip, there will be a bit more pain upstream. The industrial economy is less robust than the consumer side. Temper and carefully plan expectations with exposure to the B2B side (that’s you, OEMs and machine builders). `,
            `Look into opportunities to lock into longer term revenue opportunities to get you through this impending soft patch, according to Chausovsky, is advisable. But the flipside of that is that at these low points in cycle, prices tend to be lower—for people, equipment, for everything, really. Don’t lock in long term spending right now, Chausovsky advises, look for cheaper opportunities as they arise 12 to 18 months from now.`

        text: [
            `By Matt Reynolds, Editor`,
            `By the time Brendan Rooney, director of the Crypsis Group, gets involved in a cybersecurity matter, it’s often the case that significant damage has already been done. The Crypsis Group is a digital forensic and investigative consultancy that frequently acts as the first responder when financially motivated cyber thieves, organized crime, nation-state threat actors, and hacktivists compromise a victim network. While threats are always evolving, two primary methods of ingress Crypsis encounters, are ransomware or business email compromise (BEC).`,
            `That means that first call is a tough one for Rooney. While it’s the start of the process for him, if the brand owner or OEM he’s dealing with isn’t insured against cyber-attacks, the victim may stioll have to incur a big ransom payout out of pocket. Odds are great that the victim company will also experience a disruption in productivity or suffer possible permanent loss of data. In some cases, the victim suffers all of the above.`,
            `“Our analysis aims to get answers to three initial questions,” Rooney says. “How did attackers gain access to the system? What did they have access to? And what may have been exfiltrated from the environment?”`,
            `The following is geared toward OEMs, but much of the information applies upstream and downstream as well.`,
            `Defining terms`,
            `Ransomware is a form of malware targeting both human and technical weaknesses in an effort to make critical data/systems inaccessible. Ransomware is delivered through various vectors, including phishing attacks, and also via Remote Desktop Protocols that allow computers to connect to one another across a network.`,
            `Business Email Compromise (BEC) is a sophisticated scam targeting businesses that work with foreign suppliers and regularly perform wire transfer payments. A subset of BEC called Email Account Compromise (EAC) targets the individuals who regularly perform these payments. While most BEC and EAC victims reported using wire transfers as their regular methods of transferring business funds, some reported using checks. The fraudsters used the payment method most commonly associated with their victims’ regular business practices. Rooney says the relatively standard but often overlooked step of multi-factor authentication on business email accounts can go a long way in mitigating BEC threat.`,
            `Safeguards for OEMs to have in place before the dreaded call`,
            `Third party assessments: Many CPGs currently require unbiased, third-party opinions on network safety, benchmarking against established frameworks. Having these assessments completed and available ahead of time can be a differentiator for OEMs and can be a sales tool for new client acquisition. Rooney also mentions the flip side to that: by not having third party assessments available can be perceived as a safety deficiency, rightly or wrongly.`,
            `Insurance: While many attendees asked, there’s no magic bullet number for how much cyber insurance is enough; that’s really a business decision. Rooney did provide questions to ask yourself in making the determination: “Is your insurance program tailored to your operations? And how are you calculating potential loss?” He also noted that depending on the end user of the equipment, insurance itself may be a contractual requirement, and a differentiator from competitors.`,
            `Employee training: this can pay dividends in shoring up cyber safety. Rooney adds that most successful cyber-attacks aren’t a failure of technology, rather a failure of personnel. Frequent training of both IT and OT can minimize risk exposure, though given this is a human element, it can’t be eliminated.`,
            `Hire or outsource: Rooney recommends understanding the roles of contracted vendors, and identifying any gaps between them in security. Truly talented IT people are hard to find, and harder to keep, so perhaps outsourcing can be an option. And if there’s a question which party is responsible for security, ask questions and get that worked out as soon as humanly possible.`,
            `Steps toward improvement, according to The Crypsis Group`,
            `Even the most astute employees can be taken in by phishing scams, but training exercises can make a difference. Training exercises can make a difference.`,
            `• Ensure your organization’s personnel and partners get cybersecurity awareness training and are adequately trained to perform their day-to-day activities with cybersecurity in mind.`,
            `• Enable multifactor authentication whenever possible. The added layer of difficulty can help mitigate the risk of an intruder accessing your systems.`,
            `• Principal of least privilege: Give access only to those who need it. Really. And be strict about this.`,
            `• Application whitelisting and asset management: Ensure the data, personnel, software programs, and devices that enable the organization to achieve business purposes are identified and managed consistent with their relative importance to business objectives and the organization’s risk strategy.`,

        date: "30 | 04 | 2019",
        text: [
            `Recycled content is quickly catching on as a core part of a company’s overall sustainable packaging strategy—as well as a key strategy in improving and restoring confidence in the recycling system. For brands and suppliers embarking on the recycled content journey, the Sustainable Packaging Coalition’s new Design for Recycled Content Guide offers actionable insights and practical guidance.`,
            `We’ve all heard it at this point, the story of the China imports ban and struggling global recycling markets. This message now appears more frequently in mainstream media and the public is aware of the problem. Restoring faith in our recycling system and investing in its future depends on strong and consistent market demand for recycled materials, which depends on manufacturers using recycled content in their products and packaging.`,
            `Numerous laws and organizations’ commitments call upon industry to pursue increased use of recycled content:`,
            `• The Circular Economy Directive in Europe is calling for new extended producer responsibility (EPR) fees and exploring fee modulation based around the amount of recycled content.`,
            `• The New Plastics Economy Global Commitment calls for its signatories to “circulate the plastic produced, by significantly increasing the amounts of plastics reused or recycled and made into new packaging or products.”`,
            `• The UK Plastics Pact commits to have 30% recycled content across all packaging. France and the Netherlands just came out with similar commitments.`,
            `The timing is ripe to actively pursue recycled content strategies. The intentions are there, with many brands pledging to create demand for recycled materials by setting their own corporate goals for including more recycled content in their packaging. In the SPC’s recently launched Goals Database, we found that the number of companies making either a concrete goal or a soft commitment in recycled content usage is more than any other goal category, about 62%.`,
            `But after the goals are set, practical guidance is needed to help turn industry from intention toward action. The new Design for Recycled Content Guide serves as an important tool in a companies’ recycled content journey, offering insights on topics such as supply and demand, performance, processing, aesthetics, design, cost and strategies for success to deal with diverse challenges across material types.`,
            `The Sustainable Packaging Coalition conducted interviews with material manufacturers, packaging converters, brand owners, and retailers, collecting stories on how they navigate challenges and achieved successes. Success stories are peppered throughout the Guide.`,
            `The scope of the SPC’s Design Guide includes plastic, paper, glass and metal (aluminum and steel), all of which have very different stories and considerations.`,
            ``,
            `Plastics`,
            `In general, only high grades of recycled plastics have significant demand—like clear polyethylene terephthalate (PET) suitable for food contact, and natural colored high-density polyethylene (HDPE)—and there is not enough supply available on the market to meet current demand for these materials.`,
            `Other types of recycled plastics (resin identification codes 3 through 7) lack both quality supply and demand. For the supply that is available, there are issues of cost competitiveness to virgin plastics.`,
            `Seventh Generation is an example of a company that has successfully navigated many of the challenges associated with using recycled plastics. The company began with HDPE and has progressed to almost 100% recycled content in most of its HDPE and PET bottles today. The company has now brought polypropylene closures made of 100% recycled content to the market and recently launched some of the first flip-top closures made of 100% recycled polypropylene. Seventh Generation is also exploring the use of recycled polyethylene in low-density polyethylene (LDPE) films. It has achieved all of this in part by switching from cost savings in its product portfolio to investing in packaging sustainability.`,
            ``,
            `Paper`,
            `Paper is unique in this conversation because it comes from a renewable resource that, when responsibly managed, can also be a sustainable sourcing strategy. While virgin fiber will always be needed, using recycled fiber supports recycling markets and is appropriate for certain types of packaging.`,
            `Overall demand for recycled fiber for use in paper packaging is generally believed to exceed supply. The supply of recycled fiber is constrained, in part, by the number and capacity of recycled paper mills. Lush is an example of a company that has navigated this challenge by developing long-term relationships with dedicated recycled paper suppliers to find recycled fiber that works for its packages.`,
            ``,
            `Glass`,
            `Unlike paper or plastics, glass does not degrade. Its constraint is mainly in collection and the fact that supply availability is regional, since glass is heavy and transportation costs are high. Diageo’s Glass is Good recycling program in Brazil encourages bars, restaurants and other customers to sign up to have their used glass containers collected for recycling. The sorted glass is then transported to Glass is Good grinding sites, set up and run by local cooperatives, who grind it into cullet and store it.`,
            ``,
            `Aluminum`,
            `The specific amount of recycled aluminum in a given package is largely unknown, due to how aluminum supply chains are structured and the availability of recycled aluminum at the time a batch is made. Past efforts to market cans with consistent, high levels of recycled aluminum encountered barriers, including brand owners’ resistance to committing to a single supplier of cans, even if it meant guaranteed and verified high levels of recycled aluminum. In the case of aluminum, brand owners can help encourage a system in which more recycled aluminum usage is tracked and verified.`,
            `Working across the supply chain is vital to successfully increasing the demand for recycled content in packaging, no matter the material. The SPC Guide sets out recommendations for brands, as well as suppliers.`,
            `While there is much momentum around recycled content in packaging currently, there is still a long journey ahead until this sourcing option becomes mainstream. Our hope is that the Design for Recycled Content Guide will help brands and suppliers that are starting off on this journey. It is a living document, and we hope that you will help us build it by adding your story and updating us on your progress and learnings.`,
            `In the case of recycled content, we need to learn by doing and collectively work to build these markets, which all industry will benefit from.`

            `For the business community, uncertainty is unhelpful and with a very real risk of a no deal, priorities have changed. Investments are put on hold. Trading with the EU (and the rest of the world for that matter) could change overnight. Tariffs are now a possibility. Stockpiling has become a necessity.`,
            `The threat of a no deal has led to companies making serious preparation to limit any damage to business with industry bodies having plenty of members expressing anxiety. Which begs the question – has the relationship between the business community and politicians hit an all-time low?`,
            `Brexit critics have been routinely dismissed as peddling “project fear” by Brexit cheerleaders. But the latest economic figures indicate that the uncertainty over the UK’s future is beginning to bite. The Office for National Statistics reported that growth in the three months to November was 0.3% with manufacturers suffering their longest period of monthly falls in output since the financial crisis of a decade ago. Such news came at a time when a no deal Brexit was quite possibly on the cards. And that’s not what the industry needs.`,
            `“We have massive concerns over a possible no deal,” says Andy Barnetson, director of packaging affairs at the Confederation of Paper Industries (CPI). “It will cost vast amounts of money for our members.”`,
            `Barnetson’s fears are shared by many. What is of major concern for CPI members is any delay to the supply of goods from across the channel. This isn’t just about materials but the chemicals and adhesives needed to keep projects going. Any delays could have a fundamental impact on business.`,
            `“Yes our members are stockpiling but there are limits to what can be done,” he adds. “No one wants to be holding onto more stock than they need to.”For one business, Pollard Boxes, resources are being put into Brexit preparations, albeit with the caveat that the situation is still foggy. Pollard’s commercial director Peter Conner explains that the business is prepared for no deal “as far as we practically can”.`,
            `“It is, however, incredibly challenging to prepare when the potential impacts of a no deal Brexit are so wide ranging and unclear – particularly in the short term,” he adds. “Distraction has been the main issue as we have had to put resource and time into our contingency planning for the variety of potential eventualities from Brexit.”`,
            `Despite the amount of time and money put into the contingency plan, Conner adds that it hasn’t dented Pollard’s plans to invest.`,
            `“While this [Brexit planning] has had an impact, we have not put any investments on hold and continue to invest in new equipment to ensure we maintain the highest standards for our customers,” says Conner.`,
            `Business concerns`,
            `However, Searle reserves his main criticism for Westminster’s lack of understanding of what’s at stake. There is a feeling that MPs have little or no idea how to run a business on a day-to-day basis; a lack of understanding of what companies do. And Brexit has demonstrated this more than ever before.`,
            `“I think it’s [the relationship between business and politicians] at an all-time low,” he adds. “MPs do not understand that business is the starting point for the economy. Far too many MPs are playing party politics while the economy is creaking. Their attitude appals me.”`,
            `The CPI’s Andy Barnetson concurs: “Some MPs are calling for a no deal but they have no understanding how to do that. And to call for no deal to be ruled out is a pipe dream. Personally, I am disappointed with some MPs and they have a gap in their knowledge of business. It always has been the case and probably always will be. Business generates income for the UK but this is a basic concept that they do not understand.”`,
            `“It would seem that Brexit has been dominated by political posturing and manoeuvring on all sides, rather than a real attempt to identify a route through the process,” adds Pollard Boxes’ Conner. “For us, as a manufacturer supplying end-to-end packaging solutions for global products, this has been immensely frustrating.”`,
            `The Brexit picture may have changed as Packaging News hits your desk. A deal may have been renegotiated with Brussels, it might have squeezed through the House of Commons and the UK can finally have a clear idea of its new relationship with Europe. Perhaps there will be an extension to Article 50. Brexit might have been abandoned altogether, giving economic (although not political) stability. At the time of writing ‘no deal’ was looming fast and ‘project fear’ was giving way to ‘project reality’.`,
            `But whatever the outcome, Brexit has become a PR disaster for Westminster. It has betrayed the trust of the business community and created a wobbly economy, with memories of the previous downturn still fresh in the memory. This current generation of MPs may well have put their parties ahead of the country.`,

        date: "27 | 03 | 2019",
        text: [
            `Starbucks will begin rolling out its new lids as a replacement for those ubiquitous green straws that the company is being pressured to eliminate because, well, they’re really not so green. Customers in Seattle and Vancouver, BC, were the first to see the new lids last summer, and now they are expected to migrate to the Left Coast cities of Los Angeles and San Francisco, as well as to the midwest (Indianapolis) and points east (Washington, DC and Toronto).`,
            `The newly designed lid, called by some the “adult sippy cup,” allows customers to “sip” the company’s cold drinks through a specially designed lid made of polypropylene, a material that, while it is still plastic, “can be widely recycled,” noted an article on Starbucks’ website. Yes, it’s kind of like the sippy cup your kids used when they were learning to drink from a cup. All iced drinks will be served with the new sippy cup lid except Frappuccino, which will be served with the domed lid and a PLA or paper straw. (Be sure you don’t put that PLA straw into the recycled plastics bin or it will muck up the whole recycling stream. And as for that paper straw, it will be mush by the time you finish your drink so you can just chuck that into the trash.)`,
            `“By nature, the [plastic] straw isn’t recyclable and the lid is, so we feel this decision is more sustainable and more socially responsible,” said Chris Milne, Director of Packaging Sourcing for Starbucks. “Starbucks is finally drawing a line in the sand and creating a mold for other large brands to follow. We are raising the water line for what’s acceptable and inspiring our peers to follow suit.”`,
            `I must remind Starbucks that just because something is recyclable doesn’t mean that it will be recycled. It may not get into a recycling bin because some careless human being will throw it on the sidewalk or into some waterway.`,
            `Long term, Starbucks is working with McDonald’s to develop a globally recyclable and/or compostable hot cup solution as part of the NextGen Cup Challenge, into which the companies have invested $10 million.`,
            `Dunkin’ Brands Group Inc. has also started to make the switch by phasing out its white Styrofoam cups and replacing them with double-walled paper cups. I guess they didn’t get the memo of how environmentally unfriendly these double-walled paper cups are—they have to be lined with polyethylene to keep the hot drinks from sogging up the paper. Not to mention the huge amount of resources, especially water, it takes to make paper. Nice goin', Dunkin’!`

        text: [
            `The Coca-Cola Co. has released new flavors of Diet Coke in taller, narrower 12-ounce aluminum cans.`,
            `Launched in 2018, the line of sleeker sodas has been expanded with two flavors: strawberry guava and blueberry acai. According to Rafael Acevedo, group director for Diet Coke, Coca-Cola North America, the reconfigured aluminum cans (provided by Ball and Ardagh) were designed to connect with younger consumers.`,
            `“We wanted to be bold, think differently and be innovative in our approach,” says Acevedo. “We wanted to stay true to the essence of Diet Coke while recasting the brand for a new generation. We’re contemporizing the brand and portfolio with sleek packaging and new flavors that are appealing to new audiences.”`,
            `Coca-Cola debuted the taller cans in the United States after two years of consumer research and testing. The company checked in with more than 10,000 people across the country on possible flavors, packaging formats and design, and more. James Sommerville, vp, Coca-Cola Global Design, says the end result merges the brand’s history with a current feel.`,
            `“This visual evolution elevates the brand to a more contemporary space, while still using at its foundation the recognizable core brand visual assets,” he says. Sommerville points out the cans are tied to each other and Coca-Cola’s heritage with a vertical red band on all the packaging, called the “High Line.”`,
            `“The High Line is a Coca-Cola red disc that has gone for a walk,” he says.`,
            `According to Kerri Kopp, group director, Diet Coke, consumers have responded well to the updated cans, which appear to have boosted sales.`,
            `“Diet Coke has been trending well since its relaunch,” says Kopp. “After several years of volume declines, the brand was even on a year-to-date basis, a five-point improvement versus the historical trend. More importantly, we are growing revenue within the brand.”`,

        date: "19 | 03 | 2019",
        text: [
            `A sustainable-packaging collaboration between Amazon and Replenish has borne fruit in the form of Amazon’s Clean Revolution cleaning products. Amazon uses the new Replenish 3.0 packaging design for its Clean Revolution line, with Replenish acting as a private-label supplier.`,
            `Like earlier iterations of the Replenish Refill System, version 3.0 comprises a reusable bottle and refill pods filled with product concentrate. Each (filled) pod weighs about 4 ounces and holds enough concentrate to make six bottles of product. Amazon uses unbleached cloth bags with drawstrings as the secondary packaging for the pods and reusable bottles.`,
            `To use Clean Revolution products, consumers screw a refill pod into the bottle’s base, invert the combined package and press the bottom of the pod to release concentrate into the bottle’s built-in measuring cup. Turning the package upright, the consumer removes the sprayer/dispenser and fills the bottle with tap water to dilute the concentrate.`,
            `For Amazon and its customers, Replenish 3.0 not only encourages environmental responsibility but also reduces shipping costs. “Focusing on the ability of a reusable, concentrate-friendly platform to dramatically reduce shipping costs in ecommerce is a big deal,” says Jason Foster, Replenish founder and chief reuser. At the same time, Amazon is “tapping into the reuse movement, which is just now starting.”`,
            `Replenish sells its own CleanPath brand of home-cleaning products and foaming hand soap, also in the Replenish Refill System, online. Consumers buying the CleanPath Replenish 3.0 system can customize their product and package, choosing from multiple options for fragrance, bottle color and trim color.`,
            `Consumers can even upload digital images to be printed on their bottles. “We print directly on the bottle and can do single bottles up to tens of thousands,” Foster says. “It’s a digital printer that has the highest resolution in the industry and can print on curved surfaces.”`,
            `He adds, “We offer printing directly on the bottle for CleanPath only at this time, to showcase the capability, but we can of course offer that to any brand or retailer for products that will be powered by Replenish.”`,
            `Foster answers some questions from Packaging Digest about the Replenish Refill System, Replenish 3.0 and Amazon’s Clean Revolution products.`,
            `Please explain the differences between Replenish 2.0 and 3.0, and the reasons for these changes.`,
            `Foster: With Replenish 3.0, we shifted the platform to be completely modular and eliminated much of the ultrasonic welding and injection molding used in manufacturing Replenish 2.0. This shift in architecture not only reduced costs but allowed us to offer top-to-bottom customization, allowing brands and consumers to choose different shapes, colors, materials and bottle or refill-pod sizes. If your favorite color is yellow, you can make a yellow bottle! The goal is to offer products that reflect your personal taste and home, not the limits of a retail shelf.`,
            `Also, this move to enable full customization allows brands and retailers to easily customize the Replenish platform to fit their own brand aesthetic and create more differentiation in the marketplace.`,
            `Our mission at Replenish is to eliminate one billion plastic bottles from ever reaching the land, ocean or air—reusable, concentrate-friendly packaging can get us there. If you provide consumers with a durable, more attractive product that they feel some affinity towards, they are going to reuse it. We can break the endless cycle of disposability if we build purpose and meaning into consumer products again.`,
            `Who manufactures the Replenish Refill System?`,
            `Foster: We manufacture the platform ourselves in Aurora, CO, with the help of a network of amazing suppliers. One in particular is our blow-molding supplier GoRight Plastics, Printing, and Logistics. They can do anything and have resources I have never before found under one roof.`,
            `When did Replenish 3.0 launch?`,
            `Foster: During the second half of 2018, but we will continue to innovate and roll out new features and capabilities in 2019.`,
            `What is the printing technology used?`,
            `Foster: The Kammann CNC 2250 no-contact Hybrid Digital printer.`,
            `How durable are the graphics?`,
            `Foster: Durability of the ink is excellent—easily 300-plus dish washings, with excellent chemical resistance and scratch resistance as well.`,
            `What plastics are the Replenish 3.0 components made from?`,
            `Foster: Replenish 3.0 is fully customizable and can be made with almost any resin, including post-consumer recycled content. The only requirement is to have some clarity in the upper bottle so consumers can see the measuring cup during mixing. `,
            `In one version of Replenish being sold today, the reusable bottle is made with Eastman Chemical’s Tritan copolyester resin, while the base is polypropylene (PP), the measuring cup is made from silicone and the refill pods are made with low-density polyethylene (LDPE). But again, there are lots of options from a material standpoint.`,
            `Are these plastics recyclable?`,
            `Foster: Yes, all components are recyclable, since the bottle can be disassembled by the user. However, we all know the structural issues facing recycling right now, and our message at Replenish is: Don’t forget about the other two Rs—reduce and reuse. Our hope is the last R can recover from the mistakes of the last 30 years, but it’s not going to save us from the disposable plastic tomb modern society is burying itself in.`,
            `When did Amazon introduce the Clean Revolution products? What’s included in the line?`,
            `Foster: Our collaboration with Amazon just started in February [2019] with the introduction of the Clean Revolution line of cleaning products, a private-label brand created under the Amazon Accelerator Program. The eco-friendly cleaning line consists of a powerful Multi-Surface Cleaner and a luxurious Foaming Hand Soap that sell for about $1.50 a bottle, which is about 50% less than competing eco-friendly brands. More products are in the pipeline, as well.`,
            `What benefits does Replenish 3.0 offer ecommerce brands?`,
            `Foster: Most of the products we buy are 90% water, which is especially true in cleaning products. By designing a reusable, concentrate-friendly platform, consumers can add water at the point of consumption (the home) which eliminates the bulk and weight across the entire supply chain and in shipping to the home. Why ship 5 pounds of cleaner when you can ship the equivalent in 4 ounces? It’s a stair-step reduction in manufacturing and shipping costs, but a massive leap towards a sustainable circular economy by cutting plastic, carbon emissions and energy usage by 90%.`,
            `Bulk and weight are the real enemies in modern-day retail. It kills ecommerce profitability, and it’s the biggest source of waste. It’s time to sell consumers more of what they need and less of what they don’t.`,
            `Our hope is Clean Revolution can be a lighthouse that demonstrates all those advantages, especially at Amazon, and that helps change how consumer products are designed and sold in this new era of ecommerce and producer responsibility.`,
            `Could the Replenish system be used for other types of products?`,
            `Foster: The Replenish platform can be used across multiple product categories, like beauty, personal care, beverage, pet, garden, and industrial and household cleaning. `,
            `Are any other brand owners using the Replenish system?`,
            `Foster: We will be making some exciting announcements about new brands that will be using the Replenish platform soon.`

           `End users (both buyers and sellers) in the packaging industry are subject to many risks in the market.`,
           `Sellers may encounter dishonest buyers or one-day scams that disappear upon receiving the shipment; buyers often lose money on defected or low-quality products and supply chain bottlenecks.`,
           `Because of these risks, the packaging industry is often associated with high-risk deals to which businesses across the globe are increasingly vulnerable.`,
           `𝐐𝐮𝐚𝐥𝐢𝐭𝐲 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐀𝐜𝐜𝐮𝐫𝐚𝐜𝐲: 𝐏𝐫𝐞𝐬𝐬𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐈𝐬𝐬𝐮𝐞𝐬 𝐨𝐟 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐌𝐨𝐝𝐞𝐫𝐧 𝐏𝐚𝐜𝐤𝐚𝐠𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐈𝐧𝐝𝐮𝐬𝐭𝐫𝐲`,
           `It is too hard for the modern packaging market to guarantee users impeccable accuracy of estimates and evaluations.`,
           `1. Violation of the delivery deadlines usually causes extra costs and client dissatisfaction, which mount with the volume of the order and result in significant business losses at the end of the day.`,
           `2. Another hurdle that the participants of the packaging market come across includes the quality of merchandise.`,
           `3. The modern supply chain is global in scale and complex in operations, with numerous parties involved at its different stages.`,
           `Thus, the end user’s control over the process is often lost, given away to external parties and extremely vulnerable to a range of externalities. Even intermediate inspections often don’t help much as they may detect defective products, but still a lengthy and often troublesome process of replacing and fixing the defects in the shipment — which is again a costly process.`,
           `Such risks are poorly predicted and almost unavoidable today, thus making the participants of the global packaging market unprotected. They make smaller orders, work only with tested and verified vendors, and stick to specific supply methods to protect their assets.`,

           `What Everyone Could Do to Protect Business and Investments?`,
           `The major problem with transparency and trust in the packaging supply chain is that the chain is too long and complex. While one business owner may know his/her supplier well, it is never clear whether the supplier’s partners and vendors keep to the same principles of business integrity. Thus, matters become complicated, and you either need to accept the limitation or strive for better transparency of the entire supply chain.`,
           `Impossible, you might think? Not at all!`,
           `We made market research and hired technicians to implement the solutions to live. The result is an open platform uniting packaging suppliers and buyers in a perfectly transparent decentralized system.`,
           `The OPN has achieved a much greater degree of transparency due to the following features:`,
            `Here are only a few benefits you gain immediately:`,

            `• The back-end ledger is error-free because of the absence of the human factor.`,
